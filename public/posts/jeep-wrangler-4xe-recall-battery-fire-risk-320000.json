  "excerpt": "Big recall hits the Jeep Wrangler 4xe – potential battery fire risk has owners parking outside. Here's the rugged truth on your hybrid trail beast.",
  "content": "<p>Hey Jeep fam, if you're rolling in a Wrangler 4xe, this one's for you. Stellantis just dropped a major recall on over 320,000 plug-in hybrid Jeeps in the US alone – with the Wrangler 4xe (2020-2025 models) taking the biggest hit. We're talking high-voltage battery packs that might have damaged cell separators, opening the door to thermal runaway and fire – even when your rig's parked or crawling the trail.</p><h2>The Raw Details on the Recall</h2><p>This ain't some minor glitch. NHTSA reports show fires linked to this issue, with at least one injury noted. The high-voltage lithium-ion packs (Samsung SDI cells) can fail internally, risking spontaneous combustion day or night. Stellantis is telling owners: <strong>park outside, away from structures, and stop charging</strong> until the fix rolls out. Remedy's in the works – stay tuned for dealer notifications.</p><h2>Why It Matters for Wrangler Diehards</h2><p>The Wrangler 4xe is a beast: that 2.0L turbo-four teamed with electric torque delivers 375 hp and 470 lb-ft of twist, giving you insane low-end grunt for rock crawling and silent electric stealth on the trails. With locking differentials, killer articulation, and hybrid crawl ratios that make tough sections feel easy, it's built for adventure. But this battery fire risk throws a wrench in the mix – nobody wants their trail rig turning into a campfire.</p><ul><li><strong>Powertrain Specs</strong>: 2.0L turbo + electric motor, 375 hp combined, 470 lb-ft torque</li><li><strong>Off-Road Edge</strong>: Electric mode for zero-emission trail running, instant torque for obstacles</li><li><strong>Mod Potential</strong>: Lift it, slap on bigger tires, add armor – the 4xe handles mods like a champ (just watch that hybrid system)</li><li><strong>Recall Scope</strong>: 2020-2025 Wrangler 4xe (plus Grand Cherokee 4xe, but we know where your heart is)</li></ul><h2>Stay Rugged, Stay Safe</h2><p>Check your VIN on the NHTSA site or Jeep's portal ASAP. This hybrid Wrangler brings next-level capability to the Rubicon and beyond, but safety comes first. We'll keep you posted on the fix so you can get back to dominating the dirt.</p><p>What about you – got a 4xe in the garage? Have you dealt with recalls before, or is this your first rodeo? Drop your thoughts in the comments – let's talk trail fixes and hybrid life!</p>",
