  "excerpt": "Fellow Jeepers, a major recall hits the Grand Cherokee 4xe lineup – potential sudden loss of power could cut your adventure short. Here's the rugged rundown on what went wrong and how to handle it.",
  "content": "<p>Hey Jeep family, if you're rolling in a Grand Cherokee 4xe, listen up – this one's got teeth. Stellantis just dropped a recall on more than 91,000 of these hybrid beasts (2022-2026 models) because of a software gremlin that can cause a sudden loss of drive power. Yeah, you read that right – one second you're crawling over rocks with that sweet electric torque, the next you're dead in the water. Not the kind of surprise we want on the trail.</p><h2>The Issue: Hybrid Control Processor Glitch</h2><p>The culprit? A communication error between the Battery Pack Control Module (BPCM) and the Hybrid Control Processor (HCP). When the BPCM resets under certain conditions, the HCP misreads the signal and – boom – propulsion drops out without warning. This isn't about your locking differentials failing or articulation going soft; it's a core power delivery problem that could leave you stranded mid-obstacle or, worse, in traffic.</p><p>We're talking 91,787 affected Grand Cherokee 4xe plug-in hybrids, built from mid-2021 through late 2025. If your rig is in this range, it's time to pay attention.</p><h2>Key Details on the Recall</h2><ul><li><strong>Affected Models:</strong> 2022–2026 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe PHEV</li><li><strong>Number Impacted:</strong> 91,787 in the U.S.</li><li><strong>Root Cause:</strong> Software error in hybrid control processor misinterpreting BPCM signals</li><li><strong>Risk:</strong> Unexpected loss of drive power, increasing crash potential</li><li><strong>Remedy:</strong> Free software update at your Jeep dealer (pending final development and rollout)</li><li><strong>Owner Notification:</strong> Letters mailed starting around October 2025; check your VIN on NHTSA.gov now</li></ul><h2>Grand Cherokee 4xe Off-Road Cred Still Holds Strong</h2><p>Don't get it twisted – even with this hiccup, the Grand Cherokee 4xe remains a monster off the pavement. With up to 375 hp combined from that turbo-four and electric motor, 470 lb-ft of instant torque, Quadra-Trac II 4x4, optional electronic limited-slip differential, and a low-range crawl ratio that lets you inch over anything, it's built for the rugged life. Plug-in capability means silent stealth on the trail followed by V8-like punch when you need it. Plenty of us mod these with lift kits, bigger tires, and skid plates to push articulation and capability even further.</p><p>This recall is software-only – no hardware failures reported – so once patched, your Jeep should be back to conquering rocks, mud, and sand without missing a beat.</p><h2>Stay Safe Out There</h2><p>If your VIN is affected, don't wait for the mail – head to the NHTSA site or your dealer to confirm and schedule the fix. Better to handle it in the shop than on a remote trail where recovery means a long tow.</p><p>JeepMe community, sound off: Have you experienced any power glitches in your Grand Cherokee 4xe?
