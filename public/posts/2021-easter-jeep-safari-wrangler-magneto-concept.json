  "content": "<p>The annual Easter Jeep Safari in Moab, Utah, is where Jeep legends are born, and the 2021 edition delivered one of the most revolutionary reveals in brand history: the <strong>all-electric Wrangler Magneto concept</strong>. As Jeep enthusiasts and off-road purists, we at JeepMe couldn't contain our excitement over this battery-electric beast that proves electric power and true 4x4 capability can coexist – with a manual transmission, no less!</p><h2>The Star of the Show: Jeep Wrangler Magneto Concept</h2><p>Built on a two-door 2020 Wrangler Rubicon platform (the current JL generation), the Magneto replaces the iconic 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 with a custom axial-flux electric motor. This retrofit study isn't a full redesign but a bold exploration of electrification while preserving the Wrangler's soul. The result? A stealthy, silent, and incredibly torquey rock-crawler that hints at the future of <a href=\"/category/wrangler.html\" title=\"Wrangler News\">Jeep Wrangler news</a>.</p><h3>Key Specifications and Performance</h3><ul><li>Electric Motor: Axial-flux design, up to 6,000 rpm</li><li>Power Output: 285 horsepower</li><li>Torque: 273 lb-ft (matching the Pentastar V-6 for familiar feel)</li><li>Battery: 70 kWh lithium-ion pack (four modules, 800-volt architecture)</li><li>Transmission: Six-speed manual with unique regen on clutch engagement</li><li>Off-Road Upgrades: JPP 2-inch lift, 35-inch mud-terrain tires on 17-inch wheels, custom roll cage, Mopar Rock Rails</li><li>Water Fording: Up to 30 inches</li></ul><p>What makes this matter to Jeep owners? The Magneto delivers instant torque for unbeatable low-speed crawling control, near-silent operation on trails, and zero emissions – all while keeping the manual shifter that die-hards crave. It's a preview of how electrification could enhance, not replace, the Wrangler experience we love.

The event featured a lineup of ultra-capable machines, including the Jeepster Beach restomod paying homage to classic Jeep styling, the overland-ready Orange Peelz Wrangler, and the rugged Red Bare Gladiator. Each concept pushes boundaries in design, performance, and customization – perfect inspiration for your next build.</p><p>For official details on these innovations, see the <a href=\"https://www.media.stellantis.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stellantis Media release</a>.

Compared to the gas-powered JL Wrangler, it offers smoother power delivery and regen braking tailored for trails.
